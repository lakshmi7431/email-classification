# Email Classification System

## Overview
The Email Classification System is designed to categorize incoming support emails into predefined categories while ensuring that personal information (PII) is masked before processing. This system is intended for use by a company's support team to streamline email handling and improve response efficiency.

### Key Features
- **Email Classification**: Classifies emails into categories such as Billing Issues, Technical Support, Account Management, etc.
- **Personal Information Masking**: Masks personally identifiable information (PII) before processing.
- **API Deployment**: Exposes the functionality as a RESTful API for easy integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Persistence**: Joblib

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python and REST APIs.

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email_classification.git
   cd email_classification
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train the model**:
   Ensure you have a dataset of emails in CSV format. Update the path in `models.py` if necessary, then run:
   ```bash
   python models.py
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
